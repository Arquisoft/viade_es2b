.Technical Constraints
|===
|Constraint
|Explanation

|Descentralized architecture
|The project architecture will be descentralized, which means user data is separated from the application and users are the one who control the flow of information.In order to achieve that,we will use SOLID specifications.

|Javascript libray 
|The project interface will be develop with React. This library will desing and update effectively the proper components when the data changed.

|Programming language
|JavaScript will be used to develop this project. This programming language is friendly to user experience.

|Compatibility and adaptability
|This project can be used at any major web browser (Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, Safari...) and Operating Systems in
order to fullfill maximum market coverage.

It will allow us to lead a colaborative development and simplify the sharing and reviewing of it.

|GitHub
|Our project will be managed using GitHub, a configuration management system that will facilitate us working together.

|Continuous delivery
|The project will have several deliveries throughout its development to be review by teachers.

|Team
|This project will be developed by a random development group, with the difficulties of adaptation that this implies.

|Project budget

For that reason only free development tools were used.
